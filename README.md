# Garbage Image Classification Using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

The purpose of this project is to classify the garbage images into 6 different categories using convolutional neural network. <br />

To measure the performance, categorical entropy is selected as the loss function, 
and categorical accuracy is set to be the key performance measurement metric for each epoch. <br />

The precision, recall, and F-1 score, along with ROC&AUC at the last epoch are evaluated. <br />

Due to the limited computation power, all the neural network models are planned to be trained for 20 epochs, 
so that we can make comparison between the models applied. <br />
